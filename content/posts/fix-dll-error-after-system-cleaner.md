# DLL Error After Using System Cleaner? Here's How to Fix It (2025)

System cleaners can help free up space, but sometimes they're a little too aggressive and remove files your games need. Here's how to recover from a DLL error after using a cleaner.

## Why Does This Happen?
- Some cleaners mistakenly delete DLLs they think are unused.
- Game folders may not be excluded from cleaning rules.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Restore From Quarantine or Backup
- Check if your cleaner has a restore or quarantine feature.

### 2. Reinstall the Required Runtime
- For DirectX DLLs: install the latest DirectX End-User Runtime.
- For VC++ DLLs: install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable.

### 3. Verify Game Files
- Use your launcher's "Verify Integrity" feature.

### 4. Use a Trusted Repair Tool
- [FixMissingDLL.com](https://www.fixmissingdll.com) can scan and repair missing/corrupt DLLs automatically.

### 5. Reinstall the Game
- Sometimes, a clean reinstall is the best fix.

## Pro Tips
- Always exclude your game folders from system cleaners.
- Keep backups of your save files and settings.

> Most DLL errors after cleaning are solved by restoring files or reinstalling runtimes.
