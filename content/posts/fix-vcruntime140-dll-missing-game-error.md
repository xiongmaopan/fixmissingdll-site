# How to Fix vcruntime140.dll Is Missing Game Error (2025 Guide)

If you've ever tried to launch a PC game and were greeted by a message saying "vcruntime140.dll is missing," you're not alone. This error is especially common after a fresh Windows install or when running new games on older systems. Here's what you need to know—and how to get back in the game fast.

## Why Does This Error Happen?
- **vcruntime140.dll** is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019/2022.
- Many modern games rely on this runtime, but Windows doesn't always include it by default.
- The file can go missing after a system update, a failed game install, or accidental deletion.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Download and Install the Latest Visual C++ Redistributable
- Visit the official Microsoft website and search for "Visual C++ Redistributable."
- Download both the x86 and x64 versions, even if you're on a 64-bit system.
- Install them and restart your PC.

### 2. Verify Game Files
- If you're using Steam or Epic Games Launcher, use the "Verify Integrity of Game Files" feature. This can automatically restore missing DLLs.

### 3. Avoid Downloading DLLs from Unofficial Sites
- Never trust third-party DLL download sites. They're risky and often unsafe.

### 4. Use a Trusted Repair Tool
- Tools like [FixMissingDLL.com](https://www.fixmissingdll.com) can scan your system and repair missing or corrupted DLLs automatically.

### 5. Reinstall the Game
- Sometimes, a clean reinstall is the fastest way to restore all required files.
