# DLL Missing After Windows Update? How to Fix Gaming Issues (2025)

It's not uncommon for a Windows update to break your gaming setup by causing missing DLL errors. Here's how to get things back on track.

## Why Does This Happen?
- Updates can sometimes overwrite or remove essential runtime files.
- Game launchers may not always detect and restore these files automatically.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Identify the Missing DLL
- Read the error message to find out which DLL is missing.

### 2. Reinstall the Required Runtime
- For DirectX DLLs: install the latest DirectX End-User Runtime.
- For VC++ DLLs: install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable.

### 3. Verify Game Files
- Use your launcher's "Verify Integrity" feature.

### 4. Use a Trusted Repair Tool
- [FixMissingDLL.com](https://www.fixmissingdll.com) can scan and repair missing/corrupt DLLs automatically.

### 5. Reinstall the Game
- Sometimes, a clean reinstall is the best fix.

## Pro Tips
- Pause major Windows updates before big game releases.
- Keep a backup of your game saves and settings.
