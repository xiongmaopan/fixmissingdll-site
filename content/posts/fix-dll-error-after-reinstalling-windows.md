# DLL Error After Reinstalling Windows? Here's How to Fix It (2025)

A fresh Windows install can breathe new life into your PC, but it often comes with missing DLL headachesâ€”especially for gamers. Here's how to fix it quickly and safely.

## Why Does This Happen?
- Windows doesn't include all game runtimes by default.
- Essential DLLs (DirectX, VC++, .NET) may be missing after a clean install.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Install All Required Runtimes
- DirectX End-User Runtime
- Visual C++ Redistributable (all versions)
- .NET Framework (latest version)

### 2. Verify Game Files
- Use your launcher's "Verify Integrity" feature.

### 3. Use a Trusted Repair Tool
- [FixMissingDLL.com](https://www.fixmissingdll.com) can scan and repair missing/corrupt DLLs automatically.

### 4. Reinstall the Game
- Sometimes, a clean reinstall is the best fix.

## Pro Tips
- After reinstalling Windows, install all game runtimes before launching any games.
- Keep your drivers up to date.

> Most DLL errors after a Windows reinstall are solved by installing the right runtimes. Don't skip this step!
