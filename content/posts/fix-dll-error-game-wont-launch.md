# How to Fix Game Won't Launch Due to DLL Error (2025)

Few things are more frustrating than clicking your game and getting a DLL error instead of the main menu. Here's how to fix it and get back to playing.

## Why Does This Happen?
- The game needs a specific DLL file (like d3dx9_43.dll, vcruntime140.dll, etc.) that's missing or corrupted.
- This can happen after a Windows update, a new install, or moving games between PCs.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Read the Error Message
- Note the exact DLL file mentioned. This will guide your next steps.

### 2. Install the Required Runtime
- For DirectX DLLs: install the latest DirectX End-User Runtime.
- For VC++ DLLs: install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable (both x86 and x64).

### 3. Verify Game Files
- Use your launcher's "Verify Integrity" feature to restore missing files.

### 4. Use a Trusted Repair Tool
- [FixMissingDLL.com](https://www.fixmissingdll.com) can scan and repair missing/corrupt DLLs automatically.

### 5. Avoid Unofficial DLL Download Sites
- They're risky and often unsafe.

### 6. Reinstall the Game
- Sometimes, a clean reinstall is the fastest fix.

## Quick Tips
- Keep Windows and your drivers up to date.
- Exclude game folders from system cleaners.

> Most DLL errors that prevent games from launching are solved by installing the right runtime. Don't panic—just follow the steps!
